## Methodology

### Data Sources
- ERP usage history (12+ months)
- Supplier lead time performance
- Current safety stock settings
- Order frequency patterns

### Optimization Approach
- **Lead time analysis**: Average 25 days with variability buffers
- **Demand forecasting**: Confidence-weighted historical usage
- **Safety stock calculation**: Statistical optimization for 95% service level
- **Conservative assumptions**: 8% opportunity cost, 25% carrying cost rate

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintains current service levels
- Conservative buffer calculations
- Vendor-specific lead time adjustments
- Gradual implementation approach

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High-Impact Parts (Weeks 1-2)
- Target parts with >$500 optimization opportunity
- Update 36 safety stock triggers
- Monitor performance for 2 weeks

### Phase 2: Medium-Impact Parts (Weeks 3-4)
- Target parts with $100-500 optimization opportunity
- Update remaining 12 safety stock triggers
- Full system validation

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Refinement (Ongoing)
- Monthly performance reviews
- Quarterly optimization updates
- Vendor performance tracking

## Key Insights

### Systematic Opportunity
Only 13% of parts currently have optimal safety stock settings, indicating a plant-wide ERP configuration opportunity rather than isolated issues.

### Vendor Performance Impact
Lead time variability directly drives safety stock requirements. Improving supplier reliability could enable further optimization.

### Working Capital Efficiency
The analysis shows we can maintain the same production security with 39% less safety stock investment.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement high-impact optimizations** (>$500 opportunity)
2. **Update ERP safety stock parameters** for 36 parts
3. **Establish monitoring dashboard** for ongoing tracking

### Strategic Initiatives
1. **Vendor performance improvement** discussions with key suppliers
2. **Expand analysis** to Track and Springs departments
3. **Develop dynamic safety stock** adjustment processes

### Success Metrics
- Working capital reduction: Target $150K+ in first 90 days
- Service level maintenance: >95% in-stock performance
- Implementation efficiency: <2% forecast error increase

## Technical Details

### Safety Stock Formula
```
Optimal Safety Stock = Lead_Time_Demand + Lead_Time_Buffer + Demand_Buffer

Where:
- Lead_Time_Demand = Daily_Usage × Lead_Time_Days
- Lead_Time_Buffer = 1.65 × Daily_Usage × Lead_Time_StdDev  
- Demand_Buffer = 1.65 × Daily_Usage × Demand_CV × √Lead_Time
```

### Key Assumptions
- **Service Level**: 95% (Z-score = 1.65)
- **Carrying Cost Rate**: 25% annually
- **Opportunity Cost**: 8% annual return
- **Order Cost**: $50 per purchase order

## Data Quality

### Coverage Statistics
- **Lead Time Data**: 58 of 71 parts (82%)
- **Usage History**: 100% (12+ months)
- **Vendor Information**: 85% complete
- **Cost Data**: 100% current

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence**: 45 parts (both current and prior year usage)
- **Medium Confidence**: 12 parts (current usage only)
- **Low Confidence**: 6 parts (frequency-based estimates)

## Appendix

### Test Case: TG016L122
- **Current Safety Stock**: 250 units
- **Optimal Safety Stock**: 95 units
- **Cash Freed**: $471
- **Annual Savings**: $68
- **Implementation**: Successful test validation
